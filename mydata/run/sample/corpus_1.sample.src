Any problems in the system are most likely to be the connectors and the wiring harness. 1
The ECM should be the last item in troubleshooting the engine. 1
The programmable software contains all the fuel setting information. 1
The information determines the engine performance. 1
Flash programming is the method of programming or updating the programmable software. 1
Refer to TroubleshootingFlash Programming for the instructions on the flash programming of the programmable software. 1
The ECM is sealed and the ECM needs no routine adjustment or maintenance. 1
The electronic controls determine the injection timing, the amount of fuel that is delivered to the cylinders and the intake manifold pressure if an electronically controlled wastegate is installed. 1
These decisions are based on the actual conditions and the desired conditions at any given time. 1
The ECM has software that compares the desired engine speed to the actual engine speed. 1
The actual engine speed is determined through the crankshaft speed/timing sensor and the camshaft speed/timing sensor. 1
If the desired engine speed is greater than the actual engine speed, the ECM will instruct the electronic unit injector to inject more fuel to increase engine speed. 1
Once the ECM has determined the amount of fuel that is required, the software must determine the timing of the fuel injection. 1
At start-up, the ECM determines the top center position of the number 1 cylinder from the secondary speed/timing sensor on the camshaft. 1

The ECM also provides the signal to the solenoid in the fuel injection pump. 1
The solenoid in the fuel injection pump controls a valve in the fuel injection pump. 1
This valve controls the volume of fuel that enters the plungers. 1
By controlling the volume of fuel that enters the plungers, this controls the pressure in the fuel manifold. 1
Fuel that is not required for the engine is diverted away from the fuel injection pump back to the fuel tank. 1
The ECM adjusts injection timing and fuel pressure for the best engine performance, the best fuel economy, and the best control of exhaust emissions. 1
The programmable software inside the ECM sets certain limits on the amount of fuel that can be injected. 1
The FRC Limit is a limit that is based on intake manifold air pressure and engine rpm. 1
The FRC Limit is used to control the air/fuel ratio to control the exhaust emissions of the engine. 1
When the ECM senses a higher intake manifold air pressure, the ECM increases the FRC Limit. 1
A higher intake manifold air pressure indicates that there is more air in the cylinder. 1
When the ECM increases the FRC Limit, the ECM allows more fuel into the cylinder. 1
These limits are in the programmable software and these limits cannot be changed. 1
When the ECM detects an electronic system problem, the ECM generates a diagnostic code. 1
Also, the ECM logs the diagnostic code to indicate the time of the problems occurrence. 1
The ECM also logs the number of occurrences of the problem. 1
Diagnostic codes are provided to indicate that the ECM has detected an electrical problem or an electronic problem with the engine control system. 1
Sometimes, the engine performance can be affected when the condition that is causing the code exists. 1
If the operator indicates that a performance problem occurs, the diagnostic code may indicate the cause of the problem. 1
Use a laptop computer to access the diagnostic codes. 1
The problem should then be corrected. 1
Event Codes are used to indicate that the ECM has detected an abnormal engine operating condition. 1
The ECM will log the occurrence of the event code. 1
This does not indicate an electrical malfunction or an electronic malfunction. 1
If the temperature of the coolant in the engine is higher than the permitted limit, then the ECM will detect the condition. 1
The ECM will then log an event code for the condition. 1
System Configuration Parameters are protected by factory passwords. 1
This will prevent unauthorized reprogramming of the system and the unauthorized removal of logged events. 1
Factory passwords are calculated on a computer system that is available only to Caterpillar dealers. 1
Since factory passwords contain alphabetic characters, only an electronic service tool may change System Configuration Parameters. 1
System Configuration Parameters affect the power rating or the emissions. 1
Passwords also allow the customer to control certain programmable engine parameters. 1
Refer to TroubleshootingProgramming Parameters and TroubleshootingFactory Passwords. 1

This process will produce the net power that is available for the external load (flywheel). 5
Reduced hours of operation at full load will result in a lower average power demand. 5
A decreased average power demand should increase both the engine service life and the overhaul interval. 5
The need for an overhaul is indicated by increased fuel consumption, increased oil consumption, excessive engine blowby, and reduced power. 5
Arctic temperatures, extreme high temperatures, corrosive environments, or extreme dusty conditions contribute to premature wear and the need for an overhaul. 5
Oil consumption, fuel consumption, and maintenance information can be used to estimate the total operating cost for your Caterpillar engine. 5
Oil consumption can also be used to estimate the required capacity of a makeup oil tank that is suitable for the maintenance intervals. 5
Oil consumption is in proportion to the percentage of the rated engine load. 5
As the percentage of the engine load is increased, the amount of oil that is consumed per hour also increases. 5
The oil consumption rate (brake-specific oil consumption) is measured in grams per kW/h (lb per bhp). 5
The brake-specific oil consumption (BSOC) depends on the engine load. 5
Consult your Caterpillar dealer for assistance in determining the typical oil consumption rate for your engine. 5
When an engines oil consumption has risen to three times the original oil consumption rate due to normal wear, an engine overhaul should be scheduled. 5
There may be a corresponding increase in blowby and a slight increase in fuel consumption. 5
Costly unplanned downtime can be avoided. 5
Many original parts can be reused according to the standards for reusable parts. 5
The engines service life can be extended without the risk of a major catastrophe due to engine failure. 5
The best cost/value relationship per hour of extended life can be attained. 5
If a major engine failure occurs and the engine must be removed, many options are available. 5
An overhaul should be performed if the engine block or the crankshaft needs to be repaired. 5
If the engine block is repairable and/or the crankshaft is repairable, the overhaul cost will be less than the cost of a new engine with a similar exchange core. 5
To minimize downtime, Caterpillar Inc. recommends a scheduled engine overhaul by your Caterpillar dealer before the engine fails. 5
This process will provide you with the best cost/value relationship. 5
Overhaul programs vary according to the engine application and according to the dealer that performs the overhaul. 5
Consult your Caterpillar dealer for specific information about the available overhaul programs and about overhaul services for extending the engine life. 5
The aftertreatment system can be expected to function properly for the useful life of the engine (emissions durability period), as defined by regulation, subject to prescribed maintenance requirements being followed. 5
If an overhaul is performed without overhaul service from your Caterpillar dealer, be aware of the following maintenance recommendations. 5
These components should be inspected according to the instructions that are found in various Caterpillar reusability publications. 5
The Special PublicationSEBF8029 lists the reusability publications that are needed for inspecting the engine parts. 5
If the parts comply with the established inspection specifications that are expressed in the reusable parts guideline, the parts should be reused. 5
Reduced engine efficiency and increased fuel consumption translates into higher operating costs. 5
Therefore, Caterpillar Inc. recommends repairing out-of-spec parts or replacing out-of-spec parts. 5
The following components may not last until the second overhaul. 5
Caterpillar Inc. recommends the installation of new parts at each overhaul period. 5

Caterpillar does not warrant the quality or performance of non-Caterpillar fluids and filters. 6
When auxiliary devices, accessories, or consumables (filters, additives, catalysts), which are made by other manufacturers are used on Caterpillar products, the Caterpillar warranty is not affected simply because of such use. 6
However, failures that result from the installation or use of other manufacturers devices, accessories, or consumables are NOT Caterpillar defects. 6
Therefore, the defects are NOT covered under the Caterpillar warranty. 6
The aftertreatment system is approved for use by Caterpillar. 6
To be emission-compliant, only the approved Caterpillar aftertreatment system must be used on a Caterpillar engine. 6
In order to be emission-compliant only the approved Perkins aftertreatment system must be used on a Perkins engine. 6
To be emissions-compliant, only the approved Caterpillar aftertreatment system must be used on a Caterpillar engine. 6
The engine serial number plate 1 is on the right side of the cylinder block to the rear of the front engine mounting. 6
Caterpillar dealers need all these numbers to determine the components that were included with the engine. 6
This information permits accurate identification of replacement part numbers. 6
Always inspect lifting eyebolts and all other lifting equipment for damage before performing any lifting. 6
Never bend the eyebolts and the brackets. 6
Never perform product lifting if components are damaged. 6
Only load the eyebolts and the brackets under tension. 6
Remember that the capacity of an eyebolt is less as the angle between the supporting members and the object becomes less than 90 degrees. 6
When it is necessary to remove a component at an angle, only use a link bracket that is properly rated for the weight. 6
Read all the information within product lifting before any lifting is attempted. 6
Ensure that the correct set of lifting eyes for the assembly to be lifted have been selected. 6
Use a hoist to remove heavy components. 6
Use an adjustable lifting beam to lift the engine. 6
All supporting members (chains and cables) should be parallel to each other. 6
The chains and cables should be perpendicular to the top of the object that is being lifted. 6
To obtain the correct balance for lifting an application, adjust the chain lengths. 6
Lifting eyes are designed and installed for the specific engine arrangement. 6
Alterations to the lifting eyes and/or the engine, make the lifting eyes and the lifting fixtures obsolete. 6
If alterations are made, ensure that proper lifting devices are provided. 6
There are several different designs of lifting eyes. 6
The following sections give examples of lifting eyes on the engine. 6
The following sections give examples of lifting eyes on the engine and engine with aftertreatment. 6

Caterpillar recommends that model-specific cradles are used to store and transport engines. 6
Supporting engines on the sump/oil pan is not recommended under any circumstances. 6
This action is for both safety and quality reasons. 6
Use both lifting eyes when lifting engine assembly. 6
Correct operation and maintenance are key factors in obtaining the maximum life and economy of the engine. 6
If the directions in the Operation and Maintenance Manual are followed, costs can be minimized and engine service life can be maximized. 6
The time that is needed for the engine to reach normal operating temperature can be less than the time taken for a walk-around inspection of the engine. 6
The engine can be operated at the rated rpm after the engine is started and after the engine reaches operating temperature. 6
The engine will reach normal operating temperature sooner during a low engine speed (rpm) and during a low-power demand. 6
This procedure is more effective than idling the engine at no load. 6
The engine should reach operating temperature in a few minutes. 6
Avoid excess idling. 6
Excessive idling causes carbon buildup, engine slobber, and soot loading of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). 6

Excessive idling causes carbon buildupengine slobbersoot loading of the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). 6
These issues are harmful to the engine. 6
Gauge readings should be observed and the data should be recorded frequently while the engine is operating. 6
Comparing the data over time will help to determine normal readings for each gauge. 6
Comparing data over time will also help detect abnormal operating developments. 6
Significant changes in the readings should be investigated. 6
The exhaust gases and hydrocarbon particles from the engine first pass through Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC). 6
Some of the gasses and matter are oxidized as the gasses pass through the DOC. 6
The gasses then pass through the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). 6
The DPF collects the soot and any ash that is produced by the combustion in the engine. 6
During regeneration, the soot is converted into a gas and the ash remains in the DPF. 6
The gases finally pass through the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). 6
The gasses finally pass through the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). 6
Before the gases pass through the SCR, Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) is injected into the gas stream. 6
Before the gasses pass through the SCR, Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) is injected into the gas stream. 6
The unit injectors are controlled by the ECM. 6
The DEF injector is controlled by the ECM. 6
The mixtures of DEF and the exhaust gas pass through the SCR reducing the NOx in the exhaust emissions. 6
The DPF may require the exhaust gas temperature to rise to remove the soot. 6
If necessary, the throttle valve is operated to help in rising the exhaust temperature. 6
The engine software will control the amount of DEF that will be required to keep the exhaust emission compliant. 6
This design of DPF will not require a service maintenance interval. 6
The DPF can be expected to function properly for the useful life of the engine (emissions durability period), as defined by regulation, subject to prescribed maintenance requirements being followed. 6
A fault code will be active for any DPF system-related issue. 6
Follow the troubleshooting guide to rectify the issue. 6
If the DPF loses function, or is tampered with in any way, the check engine lamp, and an amber action (if equipped) will illuminate. 6
A fault code will also annunciate. 6
The lamps and fault code will remain active until the problem is rectified. 6
The engine and emissions control system shall be operated, used, and maintained in accordance with the instructions provided. 6
Failure to follow the instructions could result in emissions performance that does not meet the requirements applicable to the category of the engine. 6
Prompt action is critical to rectify any incorrect operation, use, or maintenance of the emissions control system. 6
Emissions regulations require that the value of the CO2 emissions be reported to the end user. 6
For this engine, 696 g/kWh was determined to be the CO2 value during the EU type approval process. 6
This value was recorded in EU type approval certificate. 6

Caterpillar Diesel Engines can operate effectively in cold weather. 6
Refer to Special PublicationSEBU5898Cold-Weather Recommendations for Caterpillar Machines. 6
Suggest steps which can be taken to minimize starting problems and operating problems when the ambient air temperature is between . 6
The operation and maintenance of an engine in freezing temperatures is complex . 6
Recommendations from your Caterpillar dealer are based on past proven practices. 6
The information that is contained in this section provides guidelines for cold-weather operation. 6
After starting the engine, the engine speed will be governed for up to a maximum of 25 seconds. 6
After this period, the engine should be operated at low loads until a minimum operating temperature of is achieved. 6
Achieving operating temperature will help prevent the intake valves and exhaust valves from sticking. 6
The cooling system and the lubrication system for the engine do not lose heat immediately upon shutdown. 6
Therefore an engine can be shut down for a period of time and the retained heat within the engine will allow the engine to start readily. 6
This means that an engine can be shut down for a period and the retained heat within the engine will allow the engine readily start. 6
This means that an engine can be shutdown for a period and the retained heat within the engine will allow the engine readily start. 6

Ensure that the glow plugs are in working order. 6
Refer to TroubleshootingGlow Plug Starting Aid- Test. 6
For jump starting with cables in cold weather, refer to the Operation and Maintenance ManualStarting with Jump-Start Cables. for instructions. 6
Correct engine oil viscosity is essential. 6
Oil viscosity affects lubrication properties and wear protection that the oil provides for the engine. 6
At temperatures below damage to engine components can occur if the engine is allowed to operate at high load and speed immediately after starting. 6
Provide cooling system protection for the lowest expected outside temperature. 6
Refer to this Operation and Maintenance ManualFluid Recommendations for the recommended coolant mixture. 6
In cold weather, check the coolant often for the correct glycol concentration to ensure adequate freeze protection. 6
Engine block heaters (if equipped) heat the engine jacket water that surrounds the combustion chambers. 6
Startability is improved. 6
Warm up time is reduced. 6
An electric block heater can be activated once the engine is stopped. 6
A block heater can be 120 V ac 600W or 240 V ac 550W. 6
Consult your Caterpillar dealer for more information. 6
After starting the engine, the engine speed will be governed for a maximum period of 25 seconds. 6
When idling after the engine is started in cold weather, increase the engine rpm from 1000 to 1200 rpm. 6
This idling will warm up the engine more quickly. 6
Maintaining an elevated low idle speed for extended periods will be easier with the installation of a hand throttle. 6
The engine should not be “raced” to speed up the warm-up process. 6

The minimum operating temperature is . 6
Warm up an engine that has cooled below normal operating temperatures due to inactivity. 6
This warm -up should be performed before the engine is returned to full operation. 6
During operation in very cold temperature conditions, damage to engine valve mechanisms can result from engine operation for short intervals. 6
This damage can happen if the engine is started and the engine is stopped many times without being operated to warm up completely. 6
When the engine is operated below normal operating temperatures, fuel and oil are not burned completely in the combustion chamber. 6
This fuel and oil causes soft carbon deposits to form on the valve stems. 6
Generally, the deposits do not cause problems and the deposits are burned off during operation at normal engine operating temperatures. 6
When starting and stopping an engine many times without being operated to warm up completely, the carbon deposits become thicker. 6
Free operation of the valves is prevented. 6
Valves become stuck. 6
Pushrods may become bent. 6
Other damage to valve train components can result. 6
For these reasons, when the engine is started, the engine must be operated until the coolant temperature is minimum. 6
Carbon deposits on the valve stems will be kept at a minimum. 6
Carbon deposits on the valve stem will be kept at a minimum. 6
This will keep carbon deposits on the valve stems at a minimum. 6
This will keep the carbon deposits on the valve stems at a minimum. 6
Carbon deposit on the valve stems will be kept at a minimum. 6
The free operation of the valves and the valve components will be maintained. 6
The engine must be warmed thoroughly to keep other engine parts in better condition. 6
The service life of the engine will be generally extended. 6
Lubrication will be improved. 6
There will be less acid and less sludge in the oil. 6
However, limit unnecessary idle time to 10 minutes to reduce wear and unnecessary fuel consumption. 6
The engine is equipped with a water temperature regulator. 6
When the engine coolant is below the correct operating temperature, jacket water circulates through the engine cylinder block and into the engine cylinder head. 6
The coolant then returns to the cylinder block via an internal passage that bypasses the valve of the coolant temperature regulator. 6
This return ensures that coolant flows around the engine under cold operating conditions. 6
The water temperature regulator begins to open when the engine jacket water has reached the correct minimum operating temperature. 6
As the jacket water coolant temperature rises above the minimum operating temperature, the water temperature regulator opens further allowing more coolant through the radiator to dissipate excess heat. 6
The progressive opening of the water temperature regulator operates the progressive closing of the bypass passage between the cylinder block and head. 6
This action ensures maximum coolant flow to the radiator to achieve maximum heat dissipation. 6
Do not restrict the air flow. 6
Restriction of the air flow can damage the fuel system. 6
Caterpillar discourages the use of all air flow restriction devices such as radiator shutters. 6
A cab heater is beneficial in very cold weather. 6
The feed from the engine and the return lines from the cab should be insulated to reduce heat loss to the outside air. 6

The engine ECM receives information from the sensors and the switches on the engine. 7
The engine ECM processes the information that is collected to control the engine. 7
By altering the fuel delivery with the fuel injectors, the engine ECM controls the speed and the power that is produced by the engine. 7

The ECM governs the engine. 7
The ECM determines the timing, the injection pressure, and the amount of fuel that is delivered to each cylinder. 7
These factors are based on the actual conditions and on the desired conditions at any given time during starting and operation. 7
For variable speed engines, the ECM uses the throttle position sensor to determine the desired engine speed. 7
The ECM compares the desired engine speed to the actual engine speed. 7
The actual engine speed is determined through interpretation of the signals that are received by the ECM from the engine speed/timing sensors. 7
Once the ECM has determined the amount of fuel that is required, the ECM must determine the timing of the fuel injection. 7
The ECM adjusts timing for optimum engine performance and for the fuel economy. 7
Actual timing and desired timing cannot be viewed with the electronic service tool. 7
The ECM determines the location of top center of the number one cylinder from the signals that are provided by the engine speed/timing sensors. 7
The ECM determines when injection should occur relative to the top center position. 7
The ECM determines when fuel injection should occur relative to the top center position. 7
The ECM determines when the fuel injection should occur relative to the top center position. 7
The ECM determines when injection should occur relative to the top center. 7
The ECM determines when injection should occur relative to top center. 7
The ECM determines when injection should occur relative to the top dead center position. 7
The ECM then provides the signal to the injector at the correct time. 7
The high-pressure fuel system is controlled by the ECM. 7
The ECM gathers data from several sensors on the engine. 7
The ECM then uses this data to adjust the quantity of fuel being delivered as well as the timing of the injection event. 7
The injection event begins when the ECM sends a signal to the injector solenoid to actuate the valve inside the injector. 7
As the valve opens, the fuel flows from the fuel rail, through the fuel line, and into the injector. 7
As the valve opens, the fuel flows from the fuel manifold (rail), through the fuel line, and into the injector. 7
As the valve opening pressure is reached, the valve is lifted and the fuel is delivered at high pressure into the combustion chamber. 7
The flash file inside the ECM establishes certain limits on the amount of fuel that can be injected. 7

The Smoke Limit Fuel is used to control the air/fuel ratio for control of emissions. 7
When the ECM senses a higher intake manifold pressure, the ECM increases the Smoke Limit Fuel. 7
A higher intake manifold pressure indicates that there is more air in the cylinder. 7
When the ECM increases the FRC Fuel Limit, the ECM changes the control signal to the injector. 7
When the ECM increases the FRC Fuel Limit, the ECM changes the control signal to the injector in order to allow more fuel into the cylinder. 7
When the ECM increases the FRC Fuel Limit , the ECM changes the control signal to the injector in order to allow more fuel into the cylinder. 7

Consult your Perkins distributor for more information. 14
Consult your Perkins distributors for more information. 14
Consult your Perkins distributor for more information on a suitable cleaner. 14
Consult your Perkins distributor for more information on these multi-grade oils. 14
Perkins require the use of the following specification of engine oil. 14
Failure to use the appropriate specification of engine oil will also reduce the life of your aftertreatment system. 14
The chemical limits were developed to maintain the expected life of the engine aftertreatment system. 14
The performance of the engine aftertreatment system can be adversely affected if oil that is not specified in table is used. 14
The life of your Aftertreatment system is defined by the accumulation of ash on the surface of the filter. 14
Ash is the inert part of the particulate matter. 14
The system is designed to collect this particulate matter. 14
There is a very small percentage of particulate matter that is left behind as the soot is burnt. 14
This matter will eventually block the filter, causing loss of performance and increased fuel consumption. 14
Most of the ash comes from the engine oil which is gradually consumed during normal operation. 14
This ash is passes through the exhaust. 14
To meet the designed life of the product, the use of the appropriate engine oil is essential. 14
The oil specification that is listed in table has low ash content. 14
The oil change interval can be adversely affected by the use of biodiesel. 14
Use oil analysis to monitor the condition of the engine oil. 14
Use oil analysis also to determine the oil change interval that is optimum. 14
API FA-4 oil is designed for use in selected on-highway applications and is NOT designed to support off-road applications, including Perkins Engines. 14
DO NOT use API FA-4 oil for Perkins engines. 14

Fully formulated, finished oils consist of base oils and of commercial additive packages. 14
These additive packages are blended into the base oils at precise percentages to help provide finished oils with performance characteristics that meet industry standards. 14
There are no industry standard tests that evaluate the performance or the compatibility of aftermarket additives in finished oil. 14
Aftermarket additives may not be compatible with the finished oils additive package, which could lower the performance of the finished oil. 14
The aftermarket additive could fail to mix with the finished oil. 14
This failure could produce sludge in the crankcase. 14
Perkins discourages the use of aftermarket additives in finished oils. 14
See the appropriate “Lubricant Viscosities”. 14
Refer to the illustration to find the correct oil viscosity grade for your engine. 14
At the specified interval, service the engine. 14
Use new oil and install a new oil filter. 14
Perform maintenance at the intervals that are specified in the Operation and Maintenance ManualMaintenance Interval Schedule. 14
Some engines may be equipped with an oil sampling valve. 14
If oil analysis is required, the oil sampling valve is used to obtain samples of the engine oil. 14
The oil analysis will complement the preventive maintenance program. 14
The oil analysis is a diagnostic tool that is used to determine oil performance and component wear rates. 14
Contamination can be identified and measured by using oil analysis. 14
The Wear Rate Analysis monitors the wear of the engines metals. 14
The amount of wear metal and type of wear metal that is in the oil is analyzed. 14
The increase in the rate of engine wear metal in the oil is as important as the quantity of engine wear metal in the oil. 14
Tests are conducted to detect contamination of the oil by water, glycol, or fuel. 14
The Oil Condition Analysis determines the loss of the oils lubricating properties. 14
An infrared analysis is used to compare the properties of new oil to the properties of the used oil sample. 14
This analysis allows technicians to determine the amount of deterioration of the oil during use. 14
This analysis also allows technicians to verify the performance of the oil according to the specification during the entire oil change interval. 14

Refer to ISO 5165 for the test method. 14
Viscosity is the property of a liquid of offering resistance to shear or flow. 14
Viscosity decreases with increasing temperature. 14
This decrease in viscosity follows a logarithmic relationship for normal fossil fuel. 14
The common reference is to kinematic viscosity. 14
Kinematic viscosity is the quotient of the dynamic viscosity that is divided by the density. 14
The determination of kinematic viscosity is normally by readings from gravity flow viscometers at standard temperatures. 14
Refer to ISO 3104 for the test method. 14
The viscosity of the fuel is significant because fuel serves as a lubricant for the fuel system components. 14
Fuel must have sufficient viscosity to lubricate the fuel system in both extremely cold temperatures and extremely hot temperatures. 14
If the kinematic viscosity of the fuel is lower than “1.4 cSt” at the fuel injection pump, damage to the fuel injection pump can occur. 14
If the kinematic viscosity of the fuel is lower than 1.4 cSt at the fuel injection pump, damage to the fuel injection pump can occur. 14
If the kinematic viscosity of the fuel is lower than 1.4 cSt at the fuel injection pump damage to the fuel injection pump can occur. 14
If the kinematic viscosity of the fuel is lower than “1.4 cSt” at the fuel injection pump, damage to the fuel injection pump can occur. 14
This damage can be excessive scuffing and seizure. 14
Low viscosity may lead to difficult hot restarting, stalling, and loss of performance. 14
High viscosity may result in seizure of the pump. 14
Perkins recommends kinematic viscosities of 1.4 and 4.5 mm2/sec that is delivered to the fuel injection pump. 14
If a fuel with a low viscosity is used, cooling of the fuel may be required to maintain 1.4 cSt or greater viscosity at the fuel injection pump. 14
Fuels with a high viscosity might require fuel heaters to lower the viscosity to 4.5 cSt at the fuel injection pump. 14
Density is the mass of the fuel per unit volume at a specific temperature. 14

Perkins recommends a value of density of 841 kg/m3 in order to obtain the correct power output. 14
Lighter fuels are acceptable but these fuels will not produce the rated power. 14
The level of sulfur is governed by emissions legislations. 14
Regional regulation, national regulations, or international regulations can require a fuel with a specific sulfur limit. 14
The sulfur content of the fuel and the fuel quality must comply with all existing local regulations for emissions. 14
Perkins 1200 series diesel engines have been designed to operate only with ULSD. 14
By using the test methods ASTM D5453, ASTM D2622, or ISO 20846 ISO 20884, the content of sulfur in ULSD fuel must be below 15 PPM (mg/kg) or 0.0015% mass. 14
By using the test methods ASTM D5453, ASTM D2622, or ISO 20846 ISO 20884, the content of sulfur in ULSD fuel must be below 15 PPM 0.0015%. 14
By using the test methods ASTM D5453, ASTM D2622, or ISO 20846 ISO 20884, the content of sulfur in LSD fuel must be below 500 PPM 0.05%. 14
By using the test methods ASTM D5453, ASTM D2622, or ISO 20846 ISO 20884, the content of sulfur in ultra low sulfur (ULSD) fuel must be below 15 PPM 0.0015%. 14
Use of diesel fuel with higher than 15 PPM sulphur limit in these engines will harm or permanently damage emissions control systems. 14
Use of diesel fuel with higher than 15 PPM sulphur limit in these engines will harm or permanently damage emissions control systems and/or shorten service interval. 14
Lubricity is the capability of the fuel to prevent pump wear. 14
The fluids lubricity describes the ability of the fluid to reduce the friction between surfaces that are under load. 14
This ability reduces the damage that is caused by friction. 14
Fuel injection systems rely on the lubricating properties of the fuel. 14
Until fuel sulfur limits were mandated, the fuels lubricity was generally believed to be a function of fuel viscosity. 14
The lubricity has particular significance to the current ultra low sulfur fuel, and low aromatic fossil fuels. 14
These fuels are made to meet stringent exhaust emissions. 14
The lubricity of these fuels must not exceed wear scar diameter of . 14
The fuel lubricity test must be performed on an HFRR, operated at . 14
Refer to ISO 12156-1. 14
The fuels system has been qualified with fuel having lubricity up to wear scar diameter as tested by ISO 12156-1. 14
Fuel additives can enhance the lubricity of a fuel. 14
Your fuel supplier can make recommendations for additives to use, and for the proper level of treatment. 14
Distillation is an indication of the mixture of different hydrocarbons in the fuel. 14
A high ratio of lightweight hydrocarbons can affect the characteristics of combustion. 14
Biodiesel is a fuel that can be defined as mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids. 14
Biodiesel is a fuel that can be made from various feedstocks. 14
The most commonly available biodiesel in Europe is Rape Methyl Ester (RME). 14
This biodiesel is derived from rapeseed oil. 14
Soy Methyl Ester (SME) is the most common biodiesel in the United States. 14
This biodiesel is derived from soybean oil. 14
Soybean oil or rapeseed oil are the primary feedstocks. 14
These fuels are together known as Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME). 14
Raw pressed vegetable oils are NOT acceptable for use as a fuel in any concentration in compression engines. 14
Without esterification, these oils solidify in the crankcase and the fuel tank. 14
These fuels may not be compatible with many of the elastomers that are used in engines that are manufactured today. 14
In original forms, these oils are not suitable for use as a fuel in compression engines. 14
Alternate base stocks for biodiesel may include animal tallow, waste cooking oils, or various other feedstocks. 14
To use any of the products that are listed as fuel, the oil must be esterified. 14
Fuel made of 100 percent FAME is generally referred to as B100 biodiesel or neat biodiesel. 14
Biodiesel can be blended with distillate diesel fuel. 14
The blends can be used as fuel. 14
The most commonly available biodiesel blends are B5, which is 5 percent biodiesel and 95 percent distillate diesel fuel. 14
B20, which is 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent distillate diesel fuel. 14
The percentages given are volume-based. 14

The neat biodiesel must conform to the latest EN14214 or ASTM D6751 (in the USA). 14
The biodiesel can only be blended in mixture of up to 20% by volume in acceptable mineral diesel fuel meeting latest edition of EN590 or ASTM D975 S15 designation. 14
In United States Biodiesel blends of B6 to B20 must meet the requirements listed in the latest edition of ASTM D7467 (B6 to B20) and must be of an API gravity of 30-45. 14
In North America biodiesel and biodiesel blends must be purchased from the BQ-9000 accredited producers and BQ-9000 certified distributors. 14
In other areas of the world, the use of biodiesel that is BQ-9000 accredited and certified, or that is accredited and certified by a comparable biodiesel quality body to meet similar biodiesel quality standards is required. 14
Aggressive properties of biodiesel fuel may cause debris in the fuel tank and fuel lines. 14
The aggressive properties of biodiesel will clean the fuel tank and fuel lines. 14
This cleaning of the fuel system can prematurely block of the fuel filters. 14
This cleaning of the fuel system can prematurely block the fuel filters. 14
Perkins recommend that after the initial usage of B20 biodiesel blended fuel the fuel filters must be replaced at 50 hours. 14
Glycerides present in biodiesel fuel will also cause fuel filters to become blocked more quickly. 14
Therefore the regular service interval should be reduced to 250 hours. 14
When biodiesel fuel is used, crank case oil and aftertreatment systems may be influenced. 14
This influence is due to the chemical composition and characteristics of biodiesel fuel, such as density and volatility, and to chemical contaminants that can be present in this fuel, such as alkali and alkaline metals (sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium). 14
Crankcase oil fuel dilution can be higher when biodiesel or biodiesel blends are used. 14
This increased level of fuel dilution when using biodiesel or biodiesel blends is related to the typically lower volatility of biodiesel. 14
In-cylinder emissions control strategies utilized in many of the industrial latest engine designs may lead to a higher level of biodiesel concentration in the sump. 14
The long-term effect of biodiesel concentration in crankcase oil is currently unknown. 14
The long-term effect of biodiesel concentration in crankcase oil is unknown. 14
The long-term effect of biodiesel concentration in crankcase oil is unknown currently. 14
Perkins recommend the use of oil analysis to check the quality of the engine oil if biodiesel fuel is used. 14
Ensure that the level of biodiesel in the fuel is noted when the oil sample is taken. 14
Due to the lower energy content than the standard distillate fuel B20 will cause a power loss in order of 2 to 4 percent. 14
In addition, over time the power may deteriorate further due to deposits in the fuel injectors. 14
Biodiesel and biodiesel blends are known to cause an increase in fuel system deposits, most significant of which are deposits within the fuel injector. 14
These deposits can cause a loss in power due to restricted or modified fuel injection or cause other functional issues associated with these deposits. 14
Perkins Diesel Fuel Cleaner T400012 is most effective in cleaning and preventing the formation of deposits. 14

Biodiesel fuel contains metal contaminants (sodium, potassium, calcium, and/or magnesium) that form ash products upon combustion in the diesel engine. 14
The ash can have an impact on the life and performance of aftertreatment emissions control devices and can accumulate in DPF. 14
The ash accumulation may cause the need for more frequent ash service intervals and cause loss of performance 14
Biodiesel has poor oxidation stability, which can result in long-term problems in the storage of biodiesel. 14
Biodiesel fuel should be used within 6 months of manufacture. 14
Equipment should not be stored with the B20 biodiesel blends in the fuel system for longer than 3 months. 14
Due to poor oxidation stability and other potential issues, it is strongly recommended that engines with limited operational time either not use B20 biodiesel blends or, whilst accepting some risk, limit biodiesel blend to a maximum of B5. 14
Examples of applications that should limit the use of biodiesel are the following: Standby Generator sets and certain emergency vehicles. 14
For standby generator sets and emergency vehicles that cannot avoid use of biodiesel blends fuel quality in the engine fuel tank must be sampled and checked monthly. 14
Test should include acid number (EN14104), oxidation stability (EN 15751 commonly know as the Rancimant test), and sediment (ISO12937). 14
For standby generator sets oxidation stability of biodiesel blend must be 20 hours or more as per EN 15751. 14
If the test shows that the fuel has degraded, fuel tank must be drained and engine flashed by running with the fresh high-quality diesel fuel. 14
If the test shows that the fuel has degraded, fuel tank must be drained and engine flashed by running with fresh high-quality diesel fuel. 14
Perkins strongly recommends that seasonally operated engines have the fuel systems, including fuel tanks, flushed with conventional diesel fuel before prolonged shutdown periods. 14

It is strongly recommended that seasonally operated engines have the fuel systems, including fuel tanks, flushed with conventional diesel fuel before prolonged shutdown periods. 14
Caterpillar recommends that seasonally operated engines have the fuel systems, including fuel tanks, flashed with conventional diesel fuel before prolonged shutdown periods. 14
If the test shows that the fuel has degraded, fuel tank must be drained and engine flushed by running with the fresh high-quality diesel fuel. 14
An example of an application that should seasonally flush the fuel system is a combine harvester. 14
Microbial contamination and growth can cause corrosion in the fuel system and premature plugging of the fuel filter. 14
Consult your supplier of fuel for assistance in selecting appropriate anti-microbial additive. 14
Water accelerates microbial contamination and growth. 14
When biodiesel is compared to distillate fuels, water is naturally more likely to exist in the biodiesel. 14
It is therefore essential to check frequently and if necessary, drain the water separator. 14
Ensure that you check frequently and if necessary, drain the water separator. 14
Frequent checks are therefore essential and if necessary, drain the water separator. 14
Therefore frequently checking for water in the fuel is essential and if necessary, draining the water separator. 14
Therefore check frequently and if necessary, drain the water separator. 14
Materials such as brass, bronze, copper, lead, tin, and zinc accelerate the oxidation process of the biodiesel fuel. 14
The oxidation process can cause deposits formation therefore these materials must not be used for fuel tanks and fuel lines. 14

In recent years various forms of renewable and alternative (synthetic) diesel fuels have started to emerge. 14
Synthetic diesel fuels are produced by gasification of various feedstock and then synthesis to liquid to obtain paraffinic diesel fuel. 14
Based on the feedstock used these fuels are commonly referred to as Biomass to liquid (BTL), Gas to liquid (GTL) and Coal to liquid (CTL). 14
Hydrotreating of vegetable oils and animal fats is another emerging process for production of bio based diesel fuel called Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO). 14
BTL and HVO fuels are considered to be low carbon fuels as they reduce carbon foot print compared to fossil fuels and are commonly referred to as renewable fuels. 14
These fuels must not be confused with biodiesel FAME which is fundamentally different fuel and is discussed in a separate section in this manual. 14
These paraffinic fuels have virtually no sulphur or aromatics and have very high cetane numbers which enable very clean burning and efficient engine operation. 14

Perkins fuel cleaner is compatible with existing and U.S. EPA Tier 4 nonroad certified diesel engine emission control catalysts and particulate filters. 14
Perkins fuel system cleaner contains less than 15 ppm of sulfur and is acceptable for use with ULSD fuel. 14
Fuels of ISO 18/16/13 cleanliness level or cleaner as dispensed into the engine or application fuel tank should be used. 14
This will reduce risk of power loss, fuel system failures, and related down time of engines. 14
This cleanliness level is important for new fuel system designs such as common rail injection systems and unit injectors. 14
These fuels systems utilize higher fuel injection pressures and have tight clearances between moving parts to meet required stringent emissions regulations. 14
Peak injection pressures in current fuel injection systems may exceed . 14
Clearances in these systems are less than 5 μm. 14
As a result, particle contaminants as small as 4 μm can cause scoring and scratching of internal pump and injector surfaces and of injector nozzles. 14
Water in the fuel causes cavitation, corrosion of fuel system parts, and provides an environment where microbial growth in the fuel can flourish. 14
Other sources of fuel contamination are soaps, gels, or other compounds that may result from undesirable chemical interactions in the fuels, particularly in ULSD. 14
Gels and other compounds can also form in biodiesel fuel at low temperatures or if biodiesel is stored for extended periods. 14
The best indication of microbial contamination, fuel additives, or cold temperature gel is rapid filter plugging of bulk fuel filters or application fuel filters. 14
To reduce downtime due to contamination, follow these fuel maintenance guidelines. 14
Fill fuel tanks with fuels of ISO 18/16/13 cleanliness level or cleaner, in particular for engines with common rail and unit injection systems. 14
When you refuel the tank, filter the fuel through a 4 μm absolute filter (Beta 4 = 75 up to 200) to reach the recommended cleanliness level. 14
This filtration should be installed at the device that dispenses the fuel to the fuel tank. 14
In addition, filtration at the dispensing point should remove water to ensure that fuel is dispensed at 500 ppm water or less. 14
Ensure that you use PerkinsAdvanced Efficiency Fuel Filters. 14
Change your fuel filters per recommended service requirements or as needed. 14
Drain your water separators daily. 14

Refer to Systems Operation, Testing and AdjustingCylinder Head - Inspect for the procedure to measure flatness of the cylinder head. 15
Use the Tooling A to check the depths of the inlet valves and the exhaust valves below the face of the cylinder head. 15
Use Tooling B to zero Tooling A. 15
For the minimum and maximum limits for a new engine for the inlet valves and the exhaust valves, refer to SpecificationsCylinder Head. 15
Service wear occurs on an engine which has been in operation. 15
If the valve depth below the cylinder head face on a used engine exceeds the specification for service wear, the following components must be replaced. 15
For the wear limits for the inlet valves and exhaust valves, refer to SpecificationsCylinder Head. 15
Check each valve for cracks. 15
Check the stems of the valves for wear. 15
Ensure that the valves are the correct fit in the valve guides. 15

Check the load on the valve springs. 15
Refer to SpecificationsCylinder Head Valves for the correct lengths and specifications for the valve springs. 15
To meet current emissions legislation requirements, a small amount of certain chemical compounds that are emitted by the engine must not be allowed to enter the atmosphere. 15
To meet current emissions legislation requirements, some certain chemical compounds that are emitted by the engine must not be allowed to enter the atmosphere. 15
The Clean Emissions Module (CEM) for the engine consists of the following components. 15
The DOC oxidizes the carbon monoxide and the hydrocarbons that are not burnt in the exhaust gas into carbon dioxide and water. 15
The DOC also acts on the oxides of nitrogen to increase the nitrogen dioxide fraction for improved efficiency of the SCR system. 15
The DOC is a through flow device that will continue to operate during all normal engine operating conditions. 15
The wall flow Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) collects all solid particulate matter in the exhaust gas. 15
A flexible exhaust pipe connects the engine to the Clean Emissions Module (CEM). 15
An exhaust elbow connects the engine to the Clean Emissions Module (CEM). 15
An exhaust pipe connects the engine to the Clean Emissions Module (CEM). 15
Refer to Disassembly and Assembly for the correct procedure to install the flexible exhaust pipe. 15
Refer to Disassembly and Assembly for the correct procedure to install the exhaust elbow. 15
Refer to Disassembly and AssemblyFlexible Exhaust Pipe for the correct procedure. 15
Refer to Disassembly and AssemblyFlexible Exhaust Pipe - Remove and Install for the correct procedure. 15
Refer to Disassembly and Assembly Hood - Install for the correct procedure. 15
Refer to Disassembly and Assembly for the correct procedure to install the exhaust pipe. 15
The solid particulate matter that is collected by the DPF consists of soot (carbon) from incomplete combustion of the fuel and inorganic ash from the combustion of any oil in the cylinder. 15
The rate of accumulation of ash is slow under normal engine operating conditions. 15
The filter is designed to contain all the ash that is produced for the useful emissions life of the engine. 15
The engine aftertreatment system is designed to oxidize the soot in the DPF at the same rate as the soot is produced by the engine. 15
The oxidization of the soot will occur when the engine is operating under normal conditions. 15
The soot in the DPF is constantly monitored. 15
If the engine is operated in a way that produces more soot than the oxidized soot, the engine management system will automatically activate the exhaust back pressure valve to raise the exhaust temperature. 15
If the engine is operated in a way that produces more soot than the oxidized soot, the engine management system will automatically activate systems to raise the exhaust temperature. 15
If the engine is operated in a way that produces more soot than the oxidized soot, the engine management system will automatically activate the inlet gas throttle valve to raise the exhaust temperature. 15
The raising of the exhaust temperature will ensure that more soot is oxidized than the soot that is produced by the engine. 15
The oxidization of more soot returns the DPF to a reduced level of soot. 15
The exhaust back pressure valve is then deactivated when the soot level has been reduced. 15
The systems are then deactivated when the soot level has been reduced. 15
The inlet gas throttle valve is then deactivated when the soot level has been reduced. 15
The engine ECM must know how much soot is in the DPF. 15
The information gathered from these two inputs is then converted into a percentage of soot output that is viewed through the electronic service tool. 15
The information gathered from the radio frequency measurement is then converted into a percentage of soot output that is viewed through the electronic service tool. 15
The information gathered from these three inputs is then converted into a percentage of soot output that is viewable through electronic soot level gauges. 15
The percentage of sulfur output that is viewed through the electronic service tool. 15
The information gathered is then converted into a percentage of soot output that is viewed through the electronic service tool. 15
The soot level may be displayed as a graphical bar, or as an actual percentage. 15
The Electronic Control Module (ECM) uses the soot measurement information to determine if the engine operating conditions need to be adjusted to oxidize the soot at an increased rate. 15
After the DPF, the exhaust gases are injected with a Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) by a Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) injector. 15
The exhaust gases and the DEF are mixed in a mixing chamber. 15
The mixture decomposes to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. 15
The mixture passes to the main Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) reaction chamber. 15
Exhaust gases and an atomized mist of ammonia and carbon dioxide enter the SCR reaction chamber. 15
Together with the SCR catalyst inside the chamber, the mixture undergoes a chemical reaction that produces nitrogen gas and water vapor. 15
There is an oxidation catalyst after the SCR catalyst. 15
The oxidation catalyst reacts with the excess ammonia to produce oxides of nitrogen and water vapor. 15
Refer to Systems Operation, Testing and AdjustingDEF Dosing Control System for more information on the DEF system. 15
The pump supplies filtered DEF fluid to the DEF injector. 15
The pump consists of inlet port 1 which is the suction side of the pump. 15
The pump then pressurizes the fluid up to and supplies the fluid though outlet port 2. 15
The pump then pressurizes the fluid up to and supplies the fluid though outlet port 40. 15
The pump then pressurizes the fluid up to and supplies the fluid though outlet port 5. 15
The pump then pressurizes the fluid up to 550 kPa80 psi and supplies the fluid though outlet port 3. 15
The pump then pressurizes the fluid up to 900 kPa130.5 psi and supplies the fluid though outlet port 40. 15
The pump then pressurizes the fluid up to and supplies the fluid though outlet port 3. 15
There is a fixed orifice within the pump that purges the pressure off the pressurized circuit. 15
This pressure relief will stabilize the pressure in the line when the DEF injector is opening and closing. 15
Once the engine is shut down, the pump will start to go into a purge mode. 15
The DEF Injector will open and the reverting valve within the pump will reverse the flow of the pump and purge the pump and pressure line. 15
This reversed flow will route any remaining DEF fluid back to the tank. 15
Refer to Operation and Maintenance Manual for the correct procedure to replace the DEF filter. 15

Controls coolant flow to the DEF tank and pump. 15
The heated lines are electrically heated lines that will turn on any time the ambient temperature is cold. 15
These lines will thaw frozen DEF after starting in cold ambient temperatures. 15
The heated lines will also stay heated during operation to prevent any freezing during operation. 15
The level sensor will measure the amount of DEF in the tank. 15
The system uses an ultrasonic level sensor to determine the amount of DEF in the DEF tank. 15
To measure the level of DEF, the sensor measures the distance to the surface of the fluid. 15
The sensor provides a signal to the DCU that will be converted into a DEF Level Percentage. 15
The sensor provides a signal to the DCU that will be converted into a "DEF Level Percentage". 15
The sensor provides a signal to the ECM that will be converted into a DEF Level Percentage. 15
This sensor is at the bottom of the tank and is integrated within the DEF Level Sensor. 15
At the bottom of the tank header next to the DEF tank header filter is the DEF quality sensor. 15
Based on these chemical properties and fluid temperature, the sensor is able to detect urea concentration with an accuracy of up to 2 percent. 15
If the sensor detects the quality of DEF is not within specifications, a fault code will trip indicating the DEF concentration is not correct. 15
The engine may derate. 15
The DEF tank stores the DEF. 15
The size of the DEF tank will depend on the application. 15
The DEF solution is made of 32.5 percent urea solution and 67.5 percent deionized water. 15
Urea is a compound of nitrogen that turns to ammonia when heated. 15
DEF does degrade over time at elevated temperatures. 15
Due to freezing risk, the tank, pump, and lines must be heated and designed to contain frozen DEF. 15
DEF header 1 contains level sensor temperature sensor and quality sensor. 15
The DEF tank header is located in the DEF tank. 15
The coolant supplied by the engine will flow through the tubes when the coolant diverter valve opens. 15
Coolant runs along the pickup tube to the bottom of the tank and then spirals around the level sensor. 15
The heat from the coolant will thaw any frozen DEF in the tank or header. 15
The heat will also prevent the DEF from freezing around the pickup tube. 15
The DEF is pulled from the bottom of the tank through a screen. 15
At the end of the DEF Pickup tube is a 100 micron filter assembly to filter debris from entering the system. 15
Located at the end of the DEF Pickup tube is a 100 micron filter to filter debris from entering the system. 15
At the end of the DEF Pickup tube is a 100 micron screen to filter debris from entering the system. 15
Located at the end of the DEF Pickup tube is a 100 micron screen to filter debris from entering the system. 15
At the end of the DEF Pickup tube is a 40 micron filter to filter debris from entering the system. 15
The DEF is returned back to the tank from the DEF injector. 15
At the bottom of the tank header near the DEF tank header filter is a tank temperature sensor. 15
The temperature sensor is a passive thermistor. 15
The resistance of the thermistor varies with temperature. 15
This sensor monitors the temperature of the DEF in the tank. 15
This temperature is used to determine when to turn on the coolant diverter valve. 15
The coolant diverter valve is a normally closed valve. 15
The valve is a unidirectional flow valve. 15
The system is used to thaw the frozen DEF fluid in the DEF tank before dosing occurs. 15
The system is used to thaw the frozen DEF fluid in the DEF tank and pump before dosing occurs. 15
Warming the system is achieved by taking warm coolant from the engine and routing the coolant through the tank and DEF pump. 15
Warming the system is achieved by taking warm coolant from the engine and routing the coolant through the DEF tank. 15
Warming the system is achieved by taking warm coolant from the engine and routing the coolant through the DEF tank and pump. 15
The coolant diverter valve will open when the tank temperature needs to be increased. 15
With the coolant diverter valve fully opened, engine coolant will flow to the DEF tank header and then back to the engine. 15
With the coolant diverter valve fully opened, engine coolant will flow to the DEF tank header and pump and then back to the engine. 15
Once the DEF tank temp is warm enough, the system will start dosing. 15
The coolant diverter valve will close to prevent any further heat transfer to the DEF tank. 15
This avoids DEF in the DEF tank overheating. 15
The usable temperature of the DEF is between . 15
After the keyswitch is moved to the OFF position, the ECM will cycle the coolant diverter valve open and then closed. 15
The coolant diverter valve is cycled open and then closed to exercise the coolant diverter valve so that the coolant diverter valve does not seize up over time. 15
The DEF injector is mounted to the Clean Emissions Module (CEM). 15
The DEF injector is a valve that injects DEF as a fine spray into the exhaust gases as an atomized mist. 15
The spray pattern being conical for good mixing with the exhaust is critical. 15
The tip of the injector, that is located in the exhaust flow, is cooled by coolant that flows through an internal coolant passage from the engine coolant supply. 15
There are two NOx sensors supplied with the engine. 15
The other NOx sensor is installed in the tube assembly after the SCR canister. 15
The engine produces NOx as the engine operates. 15
The engine out NOx sensor measures the amount and communicates that value to the ECM. 15
The engine out NOx sensor measures the amount and communicates that value to the DCU. 15
The engine out NOx sensor measures the amount and communicates that value to the Diesel Exhaust Fluid Control Unit (DCU). 15
The engine out NOx sensor measures the amount and communicates that value to the Electronic Control Module (ECM). 15
The tailpipe out NOx sensor monitors the NOx level out of the catalyst and communicates that value to the ECM. 15
Based on the engine out and the tail pipe out NOx sensor values, the flow rate of the Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) will adjust to meet the desired tail pipe out target. 15
The NOx sensor contains a sensing element, a harness, and an electronic control unit. 15
The sensing element is composed of two chambers and a heater. 15
The first chamber measures the amount of oxygen and the second chamber measure the amount of NOx and NH3. 15
Using electrochemistry, a ceramic material attracts ions at approximately and an electrode on the chamber wall measures the electrical charge in voltage or current. 15
The voltage or current signal is then received by the NOx sensors electronic control unit and interpreted into a NOx concentration. 15
The heater is used to maintain the sensing element temperature, as sensing element is sensitive to moisture. 15
If the sensor sees any moisture while at , then the moisture could quickly cool the element which would cause the element to crack. 15
At engine start-up there is always some moisture within the exhaust pipes. 15
So the sensors will not start working until the exhaust temperature around the sensors is greater than for approximately two and a half minutes. 15
The DEF flows in the heated lines from the DEF tank to the DEF pump. 15
The DEF then travels through another heated line from the DEF pump to the DEF injector. 15
The heated lines are heated by an electrical resistance. 15
Even though the system has been purged of DEF there are small quantities of DEF that can be left behind. 15
The DEF supply line, suction, and the back flow line are heated to thaw any remaining DEF in the lines. 15
The heated lines will prevent restrictions in the pump and injector once the system begins to dose. 15
Since DEF freezes at , the system can thaw the DEF before dosing. 15
Engine coolant is supplied to the DEF tank. 15
The coolant diverter valve will turn on anytime the DEF Tank temperature is less the at start-up. 15
The coolant diverter valve will turn on anytime the DEF tank temperature is less than at engine start-up. 15
The coolant diverter valve will turn on anytime the DEF Tank temperature is less the 15° C59° F at start-up. 15
The coolant diverter valve will turn on anytime the DEF tank temperature is less than 15° C59° F at engine start-up. 15
The coolant diverter valve will turn on anytime the DEF Tank temperature is less than at start-up. 15
During operation, if the DEF tank temperature drops below or ambient temperature falls below then the coolant diverter valve will activate to keep the DEF from freezing. 15
The tubes running through the tank will thaw the DEF to a useable temperature. 15
Then DEF dosing will occur once the DEF has been thawed and the DEF tank temperature is greater than . 15
The DEF dosing will not wait for the entire tank to thawed. 15
The coolant will then return to the engine water pump inlet. 15
The DEF supply lines, suction lines, and backflow lines are heated electrically. 15
The DEF dosing system must be fully functional within 70 minutes following initial start-up. 15
If the DEF has not been removed from the lines and pump during cold-weather operation, the DEF will expand as the fluid freezes and damage the pump. 15
For this reason the purge process must be followed in cold weather. 15
The purge process will take 2 minutes of run time. 15
Do NOT turn off battery power until this pump has completed the purge cycle. 15
Inducement is defined as something that helps bring about an action or a desired result. 15
The purpose of inducements is to prompt the operator to repair or perform maintenance on the emissions control system. 15
Inducement strategies are control actions required by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resource Board (ARB) Tier 4 Final and European Union (EU) Stage IV regulations. 15
Inducement strategies are control actions required by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resource Board (ARB) Tier 4 Final and European Union (EU) Stage V regulations. 15
They require actions to limit engine performance and define required indications such as visual alarms including lamps and messages, as well as audible alarms, while the control actions are imposed. 15
The times for lights, derates, and alarms will vary between EPA and EU. 15
DEF Level has unique inducement fault codes and is separate from the other inducement categories. 15
While DEF level inducements are simply based on the DEF level, the other inducement categories are based on escalating time. 15
The escalating time inducement fault code is just an indicator of what level of inducement the engine is in and how much time remains until the next level of inducement. 15
The times for each level of inducement also vary depending on if the inducement is in first occurrence or repeat occurrence. 15
The inducements are initiated by the engine ECM. 15
The Emissions Malfunction Indicator Lamp will illuminate if any inducement fault code, including DEF level, becomes active. 15
The system reaction is varied based on the category of the fault code and what inducement parameters are selected. 15
Inducements include derates and forced idle down or shutdown. 15
When the engine derates, the rpm and torque are reduced. 15
Using the electronic service tool, the customer can choose either idle or shutdown for a Level 3 inducement. 15
The engine default is shutdown. 15
Visual and audible warnings on industrial applications may vary from what is shown under the Lamp Strategy table. 15
Industrial applications will not have audible alarms. 15
“Reduced Performance” configuration allows operation of the engine for a longer period, but the engine will progressively derate the longer the engine is operated. 15
“Reduced Performance” configuration allows operation of the engine for a longer period of time, but the engine will progressively derate the longer the engine is operated. 15
Reduced Performance configuration allows operation of the engine for a longer period of time, but the engine will progressively derate the longer the engine is operated. 15
“Reduced Performance” configuration allows operation of the engine for a longer time period, but the engine will progressively derate the longer the engine is operated. 15
“Reduced Time” configuration allows operation of the engine with full power, but for a reduced amount of time. 15
This programmable parameter will define the emissions regulation that the engine will follow in the event an inducement becomes active. 15
The location of the engine must be considered before selecting this parameter. 15
The Worldwide configuration may be used in any region of the world and will be emissions-compliant. 15
The European Union may only be selected if the engine will operate in Europe. 15
Once the European Union configuration is selected, the unit cannot go back to Worldwide. 15
If used outside of this region the engine will not be emissions-compliant. 15
Only a select number of industrial engines will be allowed to select European Union configuration. 15
Changing configuration can only be done by an authorized distributor with factory passwords. 15
This configuration determines what will happen when the third level of inducement occurs. 15
In Idle Down configuration, once the engine enters the third level of inducement, the engine will experience a 100 percent derate, and the engine speed will be limited to 1000 rpm. 15
In Shutdown configuration, once the engine enters the third level of inducement, the engine will shut down. 15
The operator may restart the engine. 15
The engine will run for 5 minutes at 100 percent derate and then shut down. 15
This event will occur until the issue is resolved. 15
If low idle is set higher than 1000 rpm, then only Shutdown configuration can be selected. 15
Safe Harbor Mode (Worldwide) is a 20 minute engine run time period that the engine can be operated with full power after reaching a level 3 inducement. 15
The safe harbor mode can be used to move the machine to a location where the machine can be serviced. 15
If 20 minutes of engine running time has passed and the fault has not been corrected, the engine will reach final inducement with derates until the fault has been fixed. 15
Safe Harbor Mode (European Union) is a 30 minute engine run time period that the engine can be operated with full power after reaching a level 3 inducement. 15
If 30 minutes of engine running time has passed and the fault has not been corrected, the engine will reach final inducement with derates until the fault has been fixed. 15
Safe Harbor Mode can only be implemented up to three times. 15
Engine Emissions Operator Inducement Service Mode Override allows a technician to service inducement-related faults on a machine while having full engine operation and no derate effects. 15
This mode is initiated through a connection with the electronic service tool. 15
This mode requires a factory password to activate. 15
Engine Emissions Operator Inducement Service Mode Override can be entered as many times as necessary and does not have a time limit. 15
However, if electronic service tool loses connection, the Override will automatically turn off. 15
The electronic service tool Engine Emissions Operator Inducement Service Mode is located in the Diagnostic Tests, System Troubleshooting Section of the engine ECM. 15
There are several service tests which will be allowed to run while inducements are active. 15
Service tests provide the ability to diagnose and fix the issue that led to inducement without the use of factory passwords. 15
While these tests can always be run on machines, not all industrial applications will be able to run service tests while inducements are active. 15
In those cases, the Engine Emissions Operator Inducement Service Mode Override with factory passwords will need to be used. 15

If set to Shutdown, engine will shutdown after 5 minutes. 15
The engine may be restarted, but will only run for 5 minutes at derated condition before shutting down again. 15
This action will continue until the issue is resolved. 15

When in level 3 inducement a 5246 -0 or E1389 (3) Aftertreatment SCR Operator Inducement Severity (3) diagnostic code will become active. 15
For machines only, an audible alarm will begin to sound 20 seconds prior to the level 3 inducement. 15
A key cycle will allow safe harbor mode to kick in. 15
Safe harbor is only allowed once. 15
After safe harbor, the engine will be in level 3 final inducement. 15

The fuel then flows to the fuel transfer pump. 15
The fuel transfer pump is part of the fuel injection pump. 15
At the fuel injection pump, the fuel is pumped at an increased pressure of up to to the fuel manifold (rail). 15
Fuel that is leak off from the electronic unit injectors flows to the return line. 15
Fuel that has too high a pressure from the fuel manifold (rail) returns through the pressure relief valve to the return line. 15

The fuel pump assembly consists of a low-pressure transfer pump and a high-pressure fuel injection pump. 15
The pump assembly is driven from a gear in the rear gear train at engine speed. 15
The fuel injection pump 1 has two plungers that are driven by a camshaft. 15
The fuel injection pump 1 delivers a volume of fuel two times for each revolution. 15
The stroke of the plungers are fixed. 15
The injector will use only part of the fuel that is delivered by each stroke of the pistons in the pump. 15
The suction control valve 2 for the fuel injection pump 1 is controlled by the ECM. 15
This maintains the fuel pressure in the fuel manifold (rail) at the correct level. 15
A feature of the fuel injection pump 1 allows fuel to return to the tank continuously. 15
The fuel temperature sensor 3 measures the temperature of the fuel. 15
The ECM receives the signal from the fuel temperature sensor 3. 15
The ECM calculates the volume of fuel. 15
The fuel output of the fuel injection pump is controlled by the ECM in response to changes in the demand of fuel pressure. 15
The engine shuts off by preventing the electronic unit injectors from injecting. 15
The ECM then closes the suction control valve to prevent the pressure in the fuel manifold (rail) from increasing. 15
The ECM determines the quantity, timing, and pressure of the fuel to be injected into the fuel injector. 15
The ECM uses input from the sensors on the engine. 15
These sensors include the speed/timing sensors and the pressure sensors. 15
The ECM controls the timing and the flow of fuel by actuating the injector solenoid. 15
The amount of fuel is proportional to the duration of the signal to the injector solenoid. 15
The ECM controls the fuel pressure by increasing or decreasing the flow of fuel from the fuel injection pump. 15
If a replacement electronic unit injector is installed, the correct injector code must be programmed into the electronic control module. 15
The code that is required is at Position X. 15
Record Code X before the electronic unit injector is installed. 15
The fuel injectors contain no serviceable parts apart from the O-ring seal and the combustion washer. 15
The clamp and setscrew are serviced separately. 15
The pressurized fuel from the fuel manifold is injected into the combustion chamber by the electronic unit injector. 15
The desired injection timing, injection quantity, and injection pattern are controlled by the ECM depending on engine operating conditions. 15
The injection process is controlled using a two-way valve. 15
The supply of electrical current to the solenoid controls the two-way valve. 15
When the two-way valve is not energized the out orifice is closed and there is no fuel leak. 15
In this condition the pressure in the control chamber and the pressure at the nozzle needle are the same. 15
In this condition the spring pressure on the command piston keeps the needle closed. 15
When an injection of fuel is required, the electrical current from the ECM charges the solenoid, which in turn energizes the two-way valve and lifts the valve. 15
When the valve lifts the valve uncovers the out orifice. 15
The fuel starts to flow and reduces the pressure in the control chamber. 15
When the pressure difference at the nozzle needle exceeds the combined pressure of the control chamber pressure and the spring pressure, the nozzle lifts to start the injection process. 15
The fuel coming out of the nozzle is atomized and injected as a very fine spray. 15
When the injection needs to be stopped, the electrical current to the solenoid is cut off and the pressure difference in the control chamber starts increasing. 15
The increased pressure difference stops the injection process when the combined pressure exceeds the nozzle pressure. 15
The electronic unit injectors can be instructed to inject fuel multiple times during the combustion process. 15
A close pilot injection occurs before the main injection. 15
The close pilot injection helps to reduce NOx and noise. 15
The main injection period helps to increase the torque of the engine. 15

The high-pressure fuel will flow to the injectors. 15
The fuel pressure sensor 1 measures the fuel pressure in the fuel manifold 3. 15
The pressure relief valve 3 will prevent the fuel pressure from getting too high. 15
The fuel pressure sensor must be replaced with the fuel manifold (rail). 15
The pressure relief valve can be serviced as a separate component. 15
The components of the air inlet and exhaust system control the quality of air and the amount of air that is available for combustion. 15
Air is drawn in through the air cleaner into the air inlet of the turbocharger by the turbocharger compressor wheel. 15
The air is compressed to a pressure of about and heated to about before the air is forced to the aftercooler. 15
As the air flows through the aftercooler the temperature of the compressed air lowers to about . 16
Cooling of the inlet air assists the combustion efficiency of the engine. 16
From the aftercooler, the air flows to the air inlet connection and then to the NOx Reduction System (NRS). 16
From the aftercooler, the air flows to the air inlet connection and then to the inlet gas throttle valve for the NOx Reduction System (NRS). 16
A mixture of air and exhaust gas is then forced into the inlet manifold. 16
Air flow from the inlet manifold to the cylinders is controlled by inlet valves. 16
There are two inlet valves and two exhaust valves for each cylinder. 16
The inlet valves open when the piston moves down on the intake stroke. 16
When the inlet valves open, cooled compressed air from the inlet port is forced into the cylinder. 16
On the compression stroke, the piston moves back up the cylinder and the inlet valves close. 16
The cool compressed air is compressed further. 16
This additional compression generates more heat. 16
If the cold starting system is operating, the glow plugs will also heat the air in the cylinder. 16
Just before the piston reaches the top center (TC) position, the ECM operates the electronic unit injector. 16
Fuel is injected into the cylinder. 16
The air/fuel mixture ignites. 16
The ignition of the gases initiates the power stroke. 16
Both the inlet and the exhaust valves are closed and the expanding gases force the piston downward toward the bottom center (BC) position. 16
From the BC position, the piston moves upward. 16
This initiates the exhaust stroke. 16
The exhaust valves open. 16
The exhaust gases are forced through the open exhaust valves into the exhaust manifold. 16

As the electronically controlled valve 6 starts to open the flow of cooled exhaust gas from the exhaust cooler7 mixes with the air flow from the charge air aftercooler. 16
The mixing of the cooled exhaust gas and the air flow from the charge air aftercooler reduces the oxygen content of the gas mixture. 16
This results in a lower combustion temperature, so decreases the production of NOx. 16
As the demand for more cooled exhaust gas increases the electronically controlled valve opens further. 16
The further opening of the valve increases the flow of cooled exhaust gas from the exhaust cooler. 16
As the demand for cooled exhaust gas decreases, the electronically controlled valve closes. 16
This decreases the flow of cooled exhaust gas from the exhaust cooler. 16
The hot exhaust gas is cooled in the exhaust cooler6. 16
The hot exhaust gas is cooled in the exhaust cooler8. 16

Energy from the exhaust gas causes the turbine wheel 8 to rotate. 16
The turbine wheel is connected by a shaft to the compressor wheel 3. 16
As the turbine wheel rotates, the compressor wheel is rotated. 16
The rotation of the compressor wheel causes the intake air to be pressurized through the compressor housing 2 of the turbocharger. 16
When the load on the engine increases, more fuel is injected into the cylinders. 16
The combustion of this additional fuel produces more exhaust gases. 16
The additional exhaust gases cause the turbine and the compressor wheels of the turbocharger to turn faster. 16
As the compressor wheel turns faster, air is compressed to a higher pressure and more air is forced into the cylinders. 16
The increased flow of air into the cylinders allows the fuel to be burnt with greater efficiency. 16
This produces more power. 16
The shaft that connects the turbine to the compressor wheel rotates in bearings 4 and 6. 16
The bearings require oil under pressure for lubrication and cooling. 16
The oil that flows to the lubricating oil inlet port 5 passes through the center of the turbocharger which retains the bearings. 16
The oil exits the turbocharger from the lubricating oil outlet port 10 and returns to the oil pan. 16
A wastegate is installed on the turbine housing of the turbocharger. 16
The wastegate actuator is installed on the compressor housing of the turbocharger. 16
The wastegate valve is connected to an actuating lever. 16
The actuating lever is connected to an electronic actuated wastegate actuator. 16
Inside the wastegate actuator is an electric motor. 16
The wastegate actuator is controlled by the engine Electronic Control Module (ECM). 16
The ECM uses inputs from a number of engine sensors to determine the optimum boost pressure. 16
The ECM uses inputs from several engine sensors to determine the optimum boost pressure. 16
This will achieve the best exhaust emissions and fuel consumption at any given engine operating condition. 16
When higher boost pressure is needed for the engine performance, a signal is sent from the ECM to the wastegate actuator. 16
The actuating rod acts upon the actuating lever to close the valve in the wastegate. 16
When the wastegate valve is closed, more exhaust gas is able to pass over the turbine wheel. 16
This results in an increase in turbocharger speed and boost pressure generation. 16
When lower boost pressure is needed for the engine performance, a signal is sent from the ECM to the wastegate actuator. 16
The actuating rod acts upon the actuating lever to open the valve in the wastegate. 16
When the valve in the wastegate is opened, more exhaust gas from the engine is able to bypass the turbine wheel. 16

Any tampering with the breather system could invalidate the engines emissions compliance. 16
The engine crankcase breather is a closed circuit system. 16
A separator is built into the valve mechanism cover. 16
The separator removes most of the liquid oil from the gas. 16

The gas then passes back through the induction system via the breather outlet hose. 16
A valve is installed into a drilling in the cylinder block on the right-hand side of the engine. 16
The liquid oil passes through the valve to the engine oil pan. 16
The valve prevents gases from passing up the gallery. 16
A heated connection may be installed on the pipe for the crankcase breather. 16
The purpose of the heated connection is to prevent the formation of ice in cold climates, that could lead to an obstruction of the pipe. 16
The valve system components control the flow of inlet air into the cylinders during engine operation. 16
The valve system components also control the flow of exhaust gases out of the cylinders during engine operation. 16
The crankshaft gear drives the camshaft gear through an idler gear. 16
The camshaft 5 must be timed to the crankshaft to get the correct relation between the piston movement and the valve movement. 16
The camshaft 5 has two camshaft lobes for each cylinder. 16
The lobes operate either a pair of inlet valves or a pair of exhaust valves. 16
As the camshaft turns, lobes on the camshaft cause the lifter 4 to move the pushrod 3 up and down. 16
Upward movement of the pushrod against rocker arm 2 results in a downward movement that acts on the valve bridge 1. 16
This action opens a pair of valves 6 which compresses the valve springs 7. 16
When the camshaft 5 has rotated to the peak of the lobe, the valves are fully open. 16
When the camshaft 5 rotates further, the two valve springs 7 under compression start to expand. 16
The valve stems are under tension of the springs. 16
The stems are pushed upward in order to maintain contact with the valve bridge 1. 16
The stems are pushed upward in order to maintain contact with the valve bridge. 16
The stems are pushed upward in order to maintain contact with the valve bridge 2. 16
The stems are pushed upward to maintain contact with the valve bridge 1. 16
The continued rotation of the camshaft causes the rocker arm 2, the pushrods 3, and the lifters 4 to move downward until the lifter reaches the bottom of the lobe. 16
The valves 7 are now closed. 16
The cycle is repeated for all the valves on each cylinder. 16
The rocker arm 2 incorporates a hydraulic lash adjuster which removes valve lash from the valve mechanism. 16
The hydraulic lash adjuster uses engine lubricating oil to compensate for wear of system components so that no service adjustment of valve lash is needed. 16
The engine lubricating oil enters the hydraulic lash adjuster through a non-return valve. 16
The engine lubricating oil increases the length of the hydraulic lash adjuster until all valve lash is removed. 16
If the engine is stationary for a prolonged period the valve springs will cause the hydraulic lash adjuster to shorten so that when the engine is started engine valve lash is present for the first few seconds. 16

The cylinder cutout test is useful when troubleshooting poor engine performance or a suspected injector failure. 17
The cylinder cutout test is useful when troubleshooting poor engine performance or a suspected injector failure when used after a cylinder compression test. 17
The process involves cutting out power and restoring power to a selected cylinder. 17
The remaining powered cylinders are then monitored for expected increases in delivered fuel volume. 17
If the fuel volume does not increase, the cylinder that was not powered was not working prior to being cut out for the test. 17
A cylinder that is not working means that the power produced by that cylinder is comparatively less than the other cylinders. 17
This fault can have numerous root causes relating to the cylinder including the injector, valves, and piston. 17
The cylinder cutout test can be performed automatically or manually. 17
This function provides a way to identify misfiring cylinders when the engine is running. 17
Automatic Cylinder Cutout Test 17
Engine speed and load need to be constant and stable for the Automatic Cylinder Cutout Test average fuel measurements to be accurate. 17
Changes in engine speed and load due to auxiliary equipment during the test may lead to inaccurate results. 17
From the Diagnostics menu, select Diagnostic Tests, then Cylinder Cutout Test. 17
The automatic test will cut out power and restore power to each cylinder in turn, measuring the average fuel delivery when each cylinder is cut out. 17
Perform the Automatic Cylinder Cutout Test with the engine at approximately 50 percent load condition. 17
Running the engine with some load applied will amplify the effects of any faults and make a fault easier to detect. 17
If the engine load is too high, the vibration will be increased and the engine may stall. 17
Fuel measurements have successfully been taken when the test has completed. 17
Save the Cylinder Cutout Test results for future reference. 17
The Automatic Cylinder Cutout Test does not provide a pass/fail criteria. 17
At the end of the test, the delivered fuel volume for each cylinder will be provided. 17
The delivered fuel volume is displayed in units of cubic millimeters of governor requested fuel. 17
When a cylinder is cut out, the governor fuel will increase the requested fuel for the other powered injectors to compensate. 17
Table shows an example of when all cylinders are operating normally. 17
The delivered fuel volumes are all similar. 17
When a cylinder is cut out, the fuel delivery increases due to the loss of power from the cylinder and an additional increase in delivered fuel volume to overcome the pumping losses of the cut out cylinder. 17
If a cylinder that is weak is cut out, the fuel increase is less than cutting out a cylinder that is operating normally. 17
Table shows an example of cylinder 6 not producing any power. 17
The delivered fuel volume when cylinder 6 is cut out is the same as the delivered fuel volume when all cylinders are powered. 17
If a cylinder that is strong is cut out, the fuel increase will be more than if a cylinder that is operating normally is cut out. 17
Table shows an example of cylinder 4 producing approximately 25% more power the other cylinders which are operating normally. 17
The delivered fuel volume when cylinder 4 is cut out is higher than the delivered fuel volume when all the other cylinders are cut out. 17
Perform a manual cylinder cutout test. 17
The Manual Cylinder Cutout Test is available as a method to manually cutout a cylinder to investigate issues such as Engine Misfires Runs Rough or is Unstable or Engine Vibration is Excessive. 17
The Manual Cylinder Cutoutcan be performed on one injector or multiple injectors at once. 17
Select a cylinder to cut out, then click Change. 17
The status of the selected cylinder will change from Powered to Cutout. 17
Click Change again to change the status back to Powered. 17
More than one cylinder can be cut out simultaneously, but cutting out too many cylinders may result in the engine stalling. 17
Click Power All to power all the cylinders. 17
When a cylinder is cut out, the engine noise, vibration, or smoke can be observed to help determine whether an individual cylinder is the cause of an issue. 17
Perform a cylinder compression test to isolate injector faults from a malfunctioning cylinder. 17
If a cylinder passes the compression test, there may be a faulty injector. 17
If a cylinder fails a compression test, there may still be a faulty injector which has damaged the cylinder, such as damage from over- fueling. 17
The purpose of the Wiggle Test is to detect intermittent electrical faults in electronic control systems. 17
The Wiggle Test function allows the user to determine if there is an intermittent wiring fault. 17
The test will indicate (by changing the value reading) which parameter moved beyond a predetermined range while wiggling the wiring harness, sensor, or connector. 17
This test requires that the engine is OFF and the key switch is in the ON position (or ECM energized and 0 engine speed). 17
If the engine is started with the wiggle test active, the wiggle test will abort. 17
The Wiggle Test will reduce all ECM requirements to trip fault codes, making the diagnostics sensitive. 17
Under normal operation some fault codes need multiple occurrences before the code will log. 17
But during this test the fault codes will trip the first time. 17
The technician must wiggle and shake the wiring to check if codes go active. 17
If any parameter changes state electrically, an audible alarm is also activated. 17
Once the test has ended, the ECM returns to normal diagnostic trip requirements. 17
The purpose of this test is check that the opening pressure for the pressure relief valve is above . 17
The engine speed is automatically increased above a minimum threshold when this test is run and then the rail pressure is increased to . 17
