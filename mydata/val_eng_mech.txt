Most electrical faults are caused by poor connections. 
The following procedure will help in detecting faults with connectors and with wiring. 
If a fault is found, correct the condition and verify that the fault is resolved. 
Intermittent electrical faults are sometimes resolved by disconnecting and reconnecting connectors. 
Check for diagnostic codes immediately before disconnecting a connector. 
Also check for diagnostic codes after reconnecting the connector. 
If the status of a diagnostic code is changed due to disconnecting and reconnecting a connector, there are several possible reasons. 
The likely reasons are loose terminals, improperly crimped terminals, moisture, corrosion, and inadequate mating of a connection.

In the following illustrations, some components have been removed to improve visibility. 
The Electronic Control module (ECM) detects a low current in the circuit for the injector solenoid. 
The Electronic Control Module (ECM) detects a high current condition in the circuit for the engine retarder solenoid. 
The Electronic Control Module (ECM) detects a low current in the circuit. 
The Electronic Control Module (ECM) detects a low current condition on the circuit for the DEF purging pump. 
The Electronic Control Module (ECM) detects a low current condition for the injector solenoid. 
The warning light will come on. 
The engine will have low power and/or rough running. 
When an Cylinder Cutout Test is performed, a faulty electronic unit injector will indicate a low reading in comparison with the other electronic unit injectors. 
The ECM will continue to attempt to operate the electronic unit injector after the diagnostic code has been logged. 
An open circuit will prevent the operation of the electronic unit injector. 
The ECM detects a high current in the circuit for the injector solenoid. 
The ECM detects a low current in the circuit for the injector solenoid. 
The ECM detects a high current condition for the injector solenoid. 
A short circuit will prevent the operation of the electronic unit injector. 
Perform this procedure under conditions that are identical to the conditions that exist when the fault occurs. 
Typically, faults with the injector solenoid occur when the engine is warmed up and/or when the engine is under vibration (heavy loads). 
These engines have Electronic Unit Injectors (EUI). 
The ECM sends a pulse to each injector solenoid. 
The pulse is sent at the correct time and at the correct duration for a given engine load and speed. 
The solenoid is mounted on top of the fuel injector body. 
An electrical fault can prevent the electronic unit injector from operating. 
An open or short circuit in the ECM that is unique to one electronic unit injector will prevent that electronic unit injector from operating. 
An open or short circuit in common wiring within the ECM can prevent the two electronic unit injectors that share that common wiring from operating. 
If an open circuit is detected in the solenoid circuit, a diagnostic code is generated. 
The ECM continues to try to fire the injector. 
If a short circuit is detected, a diagnostic code is generated. 
The ECM will periodically try to fire the injector. 
If the short circuit remains, this sequence of events will be repeated until the fault is corrected. 
Use the Injector Solenoid Test to diagnose an open or short circuit diagnostic code while the engine is not running. 
The Injector Solenoid Test will send a signal to each solenoid. 
The electronic service tool will indicate the status of the solenoid as OK, Open, or Short. 
A strong electrical shock hazard is present if the keyswitch is not turned OFF. 
Connect the connectors for the engine interface connector. 
Thoroughly inspect the connectors for the injectors and the engine interface connector. 
Check the harness and wiring for abrasion and for pinch points from the injectors to the ECM.
